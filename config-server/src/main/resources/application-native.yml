# NATIVE Profile - Uses File System Config (for Dev/Local)
# This profile reads configurations from the local file system
# Location: config-repo/ (at codeJam level, separate from codejam-backend)
#
# To use this profile:
# SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=native
#
# Uses file:// path so changes are picked up immediately without recompiling
# Can be overridden with CONFIG_REPO_PATH environment variable
